`TetaNES` is a cross-platform emulator for the Nintendo Entertainment System
(NES) released in Japan in 1983 and North America in 1986, written in
[Rust][] using [wgpu][]. It runs on Linux, macOS, Windows, and in a web browser
with [Web Assembly][].

It started as a personal curiosity that turned into a passion project. It is
still being actively developed with new features and improvements constantly
being added. It is a fairly accurate emulator that can play most NES titles.

`TetaNES` is also meant to showcase using Rust's performance, memory safety, and
fearless concurrency features in a large project. Features used in this project
include complex enums, traits, generics, matching, iterators, channels, and
threads.

`TetaNES` also compiles for the web! Try it out in your
[browser](http://lukeworks.tech/tetanes-web)!

## Features

- Runs on Linux, macOS, Windows, and Web.
- Standalone emulation core in `tetanes-core`.
- NTSC, PAL and Dendy emulation.
- Headless Mode when using `tetanes-core`.
- Pixellate and NTSC filters.
- Up to 4 players with gamepad support.
- Zapper (Light Gun) support using the mouse.
- iNES and NES 2.0 ROM header formats supported.
- 14 supported mappers covering ~85% of licensed games.
- Game Genie Codes.
- Configurable while running using [egui](https://egui.rs).
  - Increase/Decrease speed & Fast Forward
  - Visual & Instant Rewind
  - Save & Load States
  - Battery-backed RAM saves
  - Screenshots
  - Gameplay recording and playback
  - Audio recording

## Getting Started

`TetaNES` runs on all major operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows, and the
web). Installable binaries will be available when `1.0.0` is released, but for the
time being you can install with `cargo` which comes installed with [Rust][].

### Install

There are multiple options for installation, depending on your operating system,
preference and existing tooling.

#### Linux

##### Ubuntu/Debian

A `.deb` package is provided under `Assets` on the latest [Release][]. Once
downloaded, you can install it and the required dependencies. e.g.

```sh
sudo apt install ./tetanes-0.10.0-1-amd64.deb
```

##### Other Distros

An [AppImage](https://appimage.org/) is provided  under `Assets` on the latest
[Release][]. Simply download it and put it wherever you want.

A `.tar.gz` package is also provided under `Assets` on the latest
[Release][]. You can place the `tetanes` binary anywhere in your `PATH`.

The following dependencies are required to be installed:

- ALSA Shared Library
- GTK3

e.g.

`apt install libasound2 libgtk-3-0`
`dnf install alsa-lib gtk3`
`pacman -Sy alsa-lib gtk3`

#### MacOS

##### App Bundle

The easiest is to download the correct app bundle for your processor. The `.dmg`
downloads can be found under the `Assets` section of the latest
[Release][].

##### Homebrew

`TetaNES` can also be installed through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```sh
brew install lukexor/formulae/tetanes
```

#### Windows

A windows installer is provided under `Assets` on the latest [Release][].

#### Cargo Install

You can also build and install with `cargo` which comes with [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

```sh
cargo install tetanes
```

This will install the latest released version of the `TetaNES` binary to your
`cargo` bin directory located at either `$HOME/.cargo/bin/` on a Unix-like
platform or `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin` on Windows.

Alternatively, if you have [`cargo binstall`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-binstall/) installed:

```sh
cargo binstall tetanes
```

This will try to find the target binary for your platform from the latest
[Release][] or install from source, similar to above.

### Directories

`TetaNES` stores to files to support a number of features, and depending on the
file type and varies based on operating system.

#### Configuration Preferences

- Linux: `$HOME/.config`
- macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support`
- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\tetanes`
- Web: Does not currently support persisting configuration preferences.

#### Screenshots

- Linux, macOS, & Windows: `$HOME/Pictures`
- Web: Does not currently support saving screenshots.

#### Replay Recordings

- Linux, macOS, & Windows: `$HOME/Documents`
- Web: Does not currently support saving recordings.

#### Audio Recordings

- Linux, macOS, & Windows: `$HOME/Music`
- Web: Does not currently support saving recordings.

#### Battery-backed RAM, save states, and logs

- Linux: `$HOME/.local/share/tetanes`
- macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/tetanes`
- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\tetanes`
- Web: Does not currently support save states.

### Powerup State

The original NES hardware had semi-random contents located in RAM upon power-up
and several games made use of this to seed their Random Number Generators
(RNGs). By default, `TetaNES` honors the original hardware and emulates
randomized powerup RAM state. This shows up in several games such as `Final
Fantasy`, `River City Ransom`, and `Impossible Mission II`, amongst others. Not
emulating this would make these games seem deterministic when they weren't
intended to be.

If you would like `TetaNES` to provide fully deterministic emulated power-up
state, you'll need to change the `ram_state` setting in the configuration menu
and trigger a power-cycle or use the `-m`/`--ram_state` flag from the command
line.

### Building/Running

To build/run `TetaNES`, you'll need a nightly version of the compiler and run
`cargo build` or `cargo build --release` (if you want better framerates).

To run the web version, you'll also need the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target and
[trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/) installed:

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
trunk serve --release
```

Unit and integration tests can be run with `cargo test`. There are also several
test roms that can be run to test various capabilities of the emulator. They are
all located in the `tetanes-core/tests_roms/` directory.

Run them in a similar way you would run a game. e.g.

```sh
cargo run --release tetanes-core/test_roms/cpu/nestest.nes
```

#### Feature Flags

- **cycle-accurate** - Enables cycle-accurate emulation. More CPU intensive, but
  supports a wider range of games requiring precise timing. Disabling may
  improve performance on lower-end machines. Enabled by default.
- **profiling** - Enables [puffin](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/puffin)
  profiling.

### Troubleshooting

If you get an error running a ROM that's using the supported Mapper list above,
it could be a corrupted or incompatible ROM format. If you're unsure which games
use which mappers, see <http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/>. Trying other
versions of the same game from different sources sometimes resolves the issue.

If you get some other error when trying to start a game that previously
worked, try removing any saved states from the directories listed above to
ensure it's not an incompatible savestate file causing the issue.

If you encounter any shortcuts not working, ensure your operating system does
not have a binding for it that is overriding it. macOS specifically has many
things bound to `Ctrl-*`.

If an an issue is not already created, please use the [github issue tracker][]
to create it. A good guideline for what to include is:

- The game experiencing the issue (e.g. `Super Mario Bros 3`). Please don't
  include any download links or ROM attachments.
- Operating system and version (e.g. Windows 7, macOS Mojave 10.14.6, etc)
- What you were doing when the error happened
- A description of the error and what happeneed
- Any screenshots or console output
- Any related errors or logs

When using the web version in the browser, also include:

- Web browser and version (e.g. Chrome 77.0.3865)
