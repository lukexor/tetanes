//! `TetaNES` is an emulator for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) released in 1983, written
//! using [Rust][rust], [SDL2][sdl2] and [WASM][wasm].
//!
//! It started as a personal curiosity that turned into a passion project. It is still
//! a work-in-progress, but I hope to transform it into a fully-featured NES emulator that can play most
//! games as accurately as possible. It is my hope to see a Rust emulator rise in popularity and compete
//! with the more popular C and C++ versions.
//!
//! `TetaNES` is also meant to showcase how clean and readable low-level Rust programs can be in
//! addition to them having the type and memory-safety guarantees that Rust is known for. Many useful
//! features of Rust are leveraged in this project including traits, trait objects, generics, matching,
//! and iterators.
//!
//! Try it out in your [browser](http://dev.lukeworks.tech/tetanes)!

//! # Dependencies
//!
//! * [Rust][rust]
//! * [SDL2][sdl2]
//!
//! # Installation
//!
//! This should run on most platforms that supports Rust and SDL2, howeer, it's only being developed and
//! tested on macOS at this time. So far, I've tested on macOS High Sierra, Mojave, Windows 7, Windows
//! 10, Linux (Fedora and Ubuntu), and Raspberry Pi 4 (though performance lacking). When 1.0.0 is
//! released, I'll make binaries available for all major platforms. Until then, follow the below
//! instructions to build for your platform.
//!
//! * Install [Rust][rust] (follow the link)
//!   * If Rust is already installed. Ensure it's up-to-date by running:
//!
//!     ```text
//!     $ rustup update
//!     ```
//!
//! * Install [SDL2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2) development libraries (follow the link)
//!   * Linux and macOS should be straightforward
//!   * Windows makes this a bit more complicated. Be sure to follow the above link instructions
//!     carefully. For the simple case of using `rustup`, all of the files in `lib\` from the Visual C++
//!     32/64-bit development zip should go in:
//!
//!     ```text
//!     C:\Users\{Your Username}\.rustup\toolchains\{current toolchain}\lib\rustlib\{current toolchain}\lib
//!     ```
//!
//!     Where `{current toolchain}` will likely have `x86_64-pc-windows` in its name. then a copy of
//!     `lib\SDl2.dll` needs to go in:
//!
//!     ```text
//!     %USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin
//!     ```
//!
//!     Next to the `tetanes.exe` binary.
//! * Download & install `TetaNES`. Stable releases can be found on the `Releases` tab at the top of
//! the page. To build directly from a release tag, follow these steps:
//!
//! ```text
//! $ git clone https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukexor/tetanes.git
//! $ cd tetanes/
//! $ git checkout v0.6.0
//! $ cargo install --path ./
//! ```
//!
//! This will install the `v0.6.0` tagged release of the `TetaNES` binary to your `cargo` bin directory
//! located at either `$HOME/.cargo/bin/` on a Unix-like platform or `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin` on
//! Windows. Replace the release tag with the one you want to install. The latest is recommended. You
//! can see which release tags are available by clicking the `Releases` tab at the top of this page or
//! by running the following command from the checked out git repository:
//!
//! ```text
//! $ git tag -l
//! ```
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! For each platform, the first `cd` command may not be needed depending on the contents of your `$PATH`
//! environment variable. `filename` should be replaced by the path to your game ROM ending in `nes`.
//! At present, only the [iNES](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/INES) format is fully supported,
//! but [NES 2.0](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_2.0) support is coming.
//!
//! ## Windows
//!
//! ```text
//! $ cd %USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin
//! $ tetanes.exe {filename}
//! ```
//!
//! ## macOS/Linux
//!
//! ```text
//! $ cd $HOME/.cargo/bin/
//! $ tetanes {filename}
//! ```
//!
//! ## Additional Options
//!
//! ```text

//!
//! ## Note on Controls
//!
//! Ctrl-(1-4) may have conflicts in macOS with switching Desktops 1-4. You can disable this in the
//! keyboard settings. I may consider changing them to something else or making macOS use the Option key
//! in place of Ctrl, but I'm not bothering with OS-specific bindings just yet.
//!
//! # Directories & Screenshots
//!
//! Battery-backed game data and save states are stored in `$HOME/.tetanes`. Screenshots are saved
//! to the directory where `TetaNES` was launched from. This may change in a future release.
//!
//! # Powerup State
//!
//! The original NES hardware had semi-random contents located in RAM upon powerup and several games
//! made use of this to seed their Random Number Generators (RNGs). By default, the binaries and build
//! steps for `TetaNES` emulate randomized powerup RAM state. This shows up in several games such as
//! Final Fantasy, River City Ransom, and Impossible Mission II, amongst others. Not emulating this
//! would make these games seem deterministic when they weren't intended to be.
//!
//! If you would like `TetaNES` to provide fully deterministic emulated powerup state, you'll need to
//! build the binary from source using the following command:
//!
//! ```text
//! $ cargo build --release --features no-randomize-ram
//! ```
//!
//! # Building/Testing
//!
//! To build the project, ensure the dependencies are installed as outlined in the `Installation`
//! section and then run `cargo build` or `cargo build --release` (if you want better framerates).
//!
//! Unit and integration tests can be run with `cargo test --features no-randomize-ram`. RAM
//! randomization is enabled by default since this more accurately reflects the original NES, but many
//! tests fail under this condition so it needs to be disabled. There are also several test roms that
//! can be run to test various capabilities of the emulator. They are all located in the `tests/`
//! directory.
//!
//! Run them in a similar way you would run a game. e.g.
//!
//! ```text
//! $ cargo run --release --features no-randomize-ram tests/cpu/nestest.nes
//! ```
//!
//! # Debugging
//!
//! There are built-in debugging tools that allow you to monitor game state and step through CPU
//! instructions manually. See the `Controls` section for more on keybindings.
//!
//! The Default debugger screen provides CPU information such as the statis of the CPU register flags,
//! Program Counter, Stack, PPU information, and the previous/upcoming CPU instructions.
//!
//! The Nametable Viewer displays the current Nametables in PPU memory and allows you to scroll up/down
//! to change the scanline at which the nametable is read. Some games swap out nametables mid-frame.
//!
//! The PPU Viewer shows the current sprite and palettes loaded. You can also scroll up/down in a
//! similar manner to the Nametable Viewer. Super Mario Bros 3 for example swaps out sprites mid-frame
//! to render animations.

//! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukexor/tetanes/master/static/debugger.png" width="808">
//!
//! Logging can be set by setting the `RUST_LOG` environment variable and setting it
//! to one of `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn` or `error`.
//!
//! # Troubleshooting
//!
//! If you get an error running a ROM that's using the supported Mapper list above, it could be
//! a corrupted or incompatible ROM format. If you're unsure which games use which mappers, see
//! [here](http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/). Trying other versions of the same game from different
//! sources sometimes resolves the issue.
//!
//! If you get some sort of nasty error when trying to start a game you've played before, try passing
//! the `--clear-savestate` option to ensure it's not an incompatible savestate file causing the issue.
//! When 1.0 releases, I'll be much more careful about backwards breaking changes with regards to
//! savestate files, but for now it's highly volatile and due to the nature of how I serialize data,
//! I can only catch certain sorts of data inconsistencies.
//!
//! If you encounter any shortcuts not working, ensure your operating system does not have a binding
//! for it that is overriding it. macOs specifically has many things bound to `Ctrl-*`. There are plans
//! to allow keybind customization, but it's not finished yet.
//!
//! If an an issue is not already created, please use the github issue tracker to create it. A good
//! guideline for what to include is:
//!
//! - The game experiencing the issue (e.g. Super Mario Bros 3)
//! - Operating system and version (e.g. Windows 7, macOS Mojave 10.14.6, etc)
//! - What you were doing when the error happened
//! - A description of the error and what happeneed
//! - Any console output
//! - Any related errors or logs
//!
//! When using the browser version (not yet available), also include:
//! - Web browser and version (e.g. Chrome 77.0.3865)
//!
//! ## Known Issues
//!
//! See the github issue tracker.
