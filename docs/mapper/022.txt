Multiple numbers, just one mapper:
--------------------------
These mapper numbers (022, 023) represent 2 wiring variations of the same mapper:  VRC2.  Each variation
operates the same, only the registers used are different because their lines are reversed from each other:

variant   lines     registers                       Mapper Number
=================================================================
VRC2a:    A1, A0    $x000, $x002, $x001, $x003      022   * divides CHR bank select by two
VRC2b:    A0, A1    $x000, $x001, $x002, $x003      023
VRC2c:    A1, A0    $x000, $x002, $x001, $x003      025   * does NOT divide CHR bank select by two

This doc will use the 'VRC2b' registers (0,1,2,3) in all following register descriptions.  For 'VRC2a',
simply reverse $x001 and $x002 registers.


VRC2a CHR:
---------------------------
Important note!  On VRC2a (mapper 022) only the high 7 bits of the CHR regs are used -- the low bit is
ignored.  Therefore, you effectively have to right-shift the CHR page by 1 to get the actual page number.

For example... both $06 and $07 would both indicate page $03

This applies to VRC2a only.  VRC2b (mapper 023) behaves normally.



VRC2 vs. VRC4:
--------------------------
VRC2 is strikingly similar to VRC4 (see mapper 021).  The differences are:

1)  VRC4 has IRQs, VRC2 does not
2)  VRC4 has 5 bits for PRG regs, VRC2 only has 4 bits
3)  VRC4 has 2 PRG modes, VRC2 does not.
4)  VRC4 has 9 bit CHR banks, VRC2 only has 8
5)  VRC4 internally supports external RAM, VRC2 does not


Those differences aside -- they act exactly the same.



Registers:
--------------------------
Some registers are mirrored across several addresses.  For example, writing to $8003 has the same effect as
writing to $8000.


$8000-$8003:  [.... PPPP]   PRG Reg 0 (select 8k @ $8000)
$9000-$9003:  [.... ..MM]   Mirroring:
%00 = Vert
%01 = Horz
%10 = 1ScA
%11 = 1ScB

$A000-$A003:  [.... PPPP]   PRG Reg 1 (select 8k @ $A000)
$B000-$E003:  [.... CCCC]   CHR Regs (see CHR Setup)


PRG Setup:
--------------------------

$8000   $A000   $C000   $E000  
+-------+-------+-------+-------+
| $8000 | $A000 | { -2} | { -1} |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+



CHR Setup:
--------------------------
The VRC2 only has 4 data pins for CHR Regs.  To compensate, two CHR regs are combined to form a single page
number.  One reg contains the high 4 bits and the other reg contains the low 4 bits (allowing for 8-bit page
numbers)

Example:  $B000+$B001  select 1k CHR page @ $0000
if   $B000=$03
and  $B001=$01
then use page $13 (VRC2b)
   or page $09 (VRC2a -- see notes above)


$0000   $0400   $0800   $0C00   $1000   $1400   $1800   $1C00
