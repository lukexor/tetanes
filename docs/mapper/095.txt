aka
--------------------------
MMC3  (modified)


Example Game:
--------------------------
Dragon Buster (J)


Notes:
---------------------------
This mapper is a modified MMC3.  It behaves exactly like your normal MMC3, only mirroring is handled
differently.  For details on MMC3, refer to mapper 004.


Regs:
---------------------------

$8000:  [CP.. .AAA]
   C = CHR Mode
   P = PRG Mode
   A = Address for $8001


This register operates exactly like it does on your normal MMC3.  It is mentioned here because the 'C' bit
has another usage for mirroring.



The normal mirroring reg ($A000) is totally ignored, and the CHR regs select nametables:

When 'C' is set:
   [ R:2 ][ R:3 ]
   [ R:4 ][ R:5 ]

When 'C' is clear:
   [ R:0 ][ R:0 ]
   [ R:1 ][ R:1 ]


For mirroring, only bit 5 of the CHR regs is significant.  Bit 5 of the appropriate reg selects either NTA or
NTB.
